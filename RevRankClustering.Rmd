Let's try to cluster the genes using the best-friends list

`r library('knitr')`
`r options(width=80,keep.source=TRUE)`
`r opts_chunk$set(echo=T,message=F,cache=F,warning=F)`
<!-- cache is off, we save all the neccessary things in Rda -->

### Clustering Task

For each gene $g_i$ we have a ranked list of all the genes that is based on the ranking of $F(j|i)$ value (see <a href=RevRank.html>the best friends by ranking of reverse ranks</a> document), let's denote the list for $g_i$ as $F_i$ list. The $j_{th}$ gene in the list is $F_i^j$. The position of the gene G in $F_i$ is $r(G,F_i)$. Obviously, $G=F_i^{r(G,F_i)}$ and $k=r(F_i^k,F_i)$.

Let's define the simplest cluster (0-cluster) as such a set of genes $C$ that for each $g_i \in C \{F_i^k, k=1..|C|\} = C$ 

```{r source, echo=FALSE}
source('backwards.rank.R')
```
