best-friends
============

This is an implementation of the gest.briends test.

The idea is: we have N tags and K clouds and their relation (attention from clound to tags) described as NxK matrix.
The stronger is the relation, the higher is the number. Here we propose statistical test whether the most friendly comunity of a tag is a real best friend of the tag.  

The R package is at favorov/best-friends/R/best.friends.  

Fresh copy of R package without editing history (BioC submission) is at 
favorov/best.friends
