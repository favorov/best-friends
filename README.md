Friends test
============

This is an implementation of the friends test (friends.test in R), formely known as best.friends and gene.friends .

The idea is: we have two sets of elements, and elements of the second ($C$) pays some attention to elements of the first ($T$), 
and the strength of the attention is described by a $|T|x|C|$ matrix. The stronger is the attention, the higher is the number. 
Here we propose a method that identifies the C elemetns that friends to particular elements of T.

To be a friend means to pay attention to a $t \n T$ element that is higher than for other elements of $T$
