best-friends
============

This is an implementation of the gest.briends test.

The idea is: we have T tags and C collections and their relation (attention from clound to tags) described as TxC matrix.
The stronger is the relation, the higher is the number. Here we propose a method that identifies the collection(s) that are best friends of tags.

The R package is at favorov/best-friends/R/best.friends.  

Fresh copy of the R package release without editing history (BioC submission) is at 
favorov/best.friends
