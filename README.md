best-friends
============

This is an implementation of the gest.briends test.

The idea is: we have N elements and M communities and 
relations described as NxM matrix.
The stronger is the relation, the higher is the number.
For each element, we wnat to know the most friendly community.  

The R package is at favorov/best-friends/R/best.friends.  

Fresh copy of R package without editing history (BioC submission) is at 
favorov/best.friends
