#' friends.test: A package that checks if a partition element in a bipartite 
#' graph has friends in the other partition.
#' 
#' We have two sets:T (rows) and C (columns) and 
#' A real matrix A(t,c) that describes the strength of association 
#' between each t and each c; t is an element of T and c is an element of C. 
#' For each t we want to identify whether it is significantly more 
#' relevant for some c's than for the remaining c's.
#' If it does, those c for which the t is relevant, 
#' are the t's friend. And, the t is the c's marker.
#' For each tag, we want to identify the collection(s) that specifically prefer(s) the tag. 
#' We say that such a collection is a friend (or the best friend if it is the only) for the tag. 
#' The simplest example: imagine that only one collection pays attention to our tag.

#' @section friends.test functions:
#' [friends.test] finds whether there column(s) that are friends for a row 
#' and find them if they do. The friends presence is tested by rejecting
#' the null hypothesis that claims that all the ranks of a row in different columns 
#' are uniformly i.i.d
#'
#' [unif.ks.test] tests uniformity of a integer vector, the uniformity corresponds 
#' to the "has-no-friends" uniform null model.
#'
#' [step.fit.ln.likelihoods] fits a integer vector with one-step model, 
#' step contains friends.
#' 
#' [friends.test.bic] finds whether there column(s) that are friends for a row 
#' and find them if they do. The friends presence is tested by comparing the
#' likelihood of splitting and non-splitting models
#' 
#'
#' [tag.int.ranks] is use by all above to prepare the integer vector to test. They are ranks of attentian that a collection pays to different tags. The ranking happens inside different collections separately. The ties are resolved at random, to keep the ranks integer.
