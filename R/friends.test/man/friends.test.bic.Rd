\usage{
friends.test.bic(A = NULL, prior.to.have.friends = -1, max.friends.n = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{original association matrix}

\item{prior.to.have.friends}{The prior for a row to have friendly columns.}

\item{max.friends.n}{The maximal number of friends for a marker, the default
is \code{'all'}, that is an alias for #of columns in A.
The string "all" means "all friends", i.e. we do not filter by this parameter
value. A value $n$ means that we filter out a row if it has more
than $n$ friendly columns. 1 means we look only for unuque (best) friends.}
}
\value{
A data.frame, rows are pairs of tags and collections that are markers and best friends
friends.
}
\description{
We have two sets:T (rows) and C (columns) and
A real matrix A(t,c) that describes the strength of association
between each t and each c; t is an element of T and c is an element of C.
For each t we want to identify whether it is significantly more
relevant for some c's than for the remaining c's.
If it does, those c for which the t is relevant,
are the t's friend. And, the t is the c's marker.
