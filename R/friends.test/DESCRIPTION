Description: We have two sets:T (rows) and C (columns) and 
    A real matrix A(t,c) that describes the strength of association 
    between each t and each c; t is an element of T and c is an element of C. 
    For each t we want to identify whether it is significantly more 
    relevant for some c's than for the remaining c's.
    If it does, those c for which the t is relevant, 
    are the t's friend. And, the t is the c's marker.
