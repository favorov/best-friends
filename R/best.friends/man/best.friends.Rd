\title{best.friends: A package that describe wheteher a community is a best friend (or one of the best friends) for its member.}
\description{
We have a list of intersecting communities, and the membership of all the elements is represened by real value.
It can be a fuzzy inclusion or, maybe, different status of members in a  communities. The absence of a relation (E is not a member of C at all)
is supposed to be represented by the smallest value, naturally, it is 0 and all the memberships are positive.
The membership is a ExC matrix.
}
\details{
We want to find the community that specifically prefers an element.
We say that the community are  friendly to the elements. The simplest: suppose an element that is mebmer of only one community.
The member is a marker for the community (if we see him, all the community is around) and the community is friendly to him (all others do not like him).
We say that the community is a friend (or best friend) of an element if it prefers the element more than other commities do and the difference is unlikely to be at random.

\section{best.friends functions}{

\link{best.friends.test} takes the elements x communities matrix, and for each element provides the community that is the potential best friend of the element and the corresponding p-value. The p-value is about the null hypothesis that the difference between the best and the next ranks of the element in communities a result of randomess. If p-value is low and the null is rejected, the community is the best friend of the element and the element is the community marker.

\link{friends.test} does the same, but it considers n (possibly, all) the communities as potential friends for each member, and p-values are generated for each element+community pair. The p-values tests the null hyposthesis that claims that the differnce of the elements's ranks in this community and in the next-by-member-rank-of-the-element community is by random. If p-value is low and the null is rejected, the element reliably separates the comumities.
