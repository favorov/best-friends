# Introduction
There is a simple intuition of what it means to be a friend. A friend of Augustus cares about Augustus more than about other people. And, if we see Augustus, then we infer to see friends(s) of Augustus also. Letâ€™s translate it into statistical language.

Consider a set of genes and their loads in a set of expression patterns. Each pattern represents a biological process by the expression levels of the involved genes. 

Sometimes, the expression of a single gene indicates the activity of the entire pattern. In the simplest case, the gene has a nonzero load in only one pattern. 
Moreover, the gene may have several nonzero loads, but all of them but one are relatively small. Then the gene (AKA Augustus) is the marker gene for the pattern, and the marked pattern is the best friend of this gene. We want to identify the marker genes and corresponding patterns statistically.  

\paragraph{Model} The bipartite graph naturally fits this model. To generalise the example, we will refer to genes as \textit{{\tag}s}, and to expression patterns, as \textit{{\collection}s}, and to any load as \textit{attention}. The sketch below illustrates the setting.

![The bipartite graph picture shows only edges with nonzero values](bipartite.png){width=25%}

To be more specific, we are given a set of collections $C = \{c_1, \dots, c_k\}$, and a set of tags $T = \{t_1, \dots, t_n\}$.
Each tag $t \in T$ and collection $c \in C$ are related by the attention $A(t, c)$, that the cloud pays to the tag. The strength of attention varies from $0$ to infinity, $A(t, c)\ge 0$. 

In the following, the attention values are stored in $n\times k$ matrix $\mathcal{A}$. 

The tag-collection-attention model applies to many problems in bioinformatics and statistics.

        Example                           tag $t$         collection $c$                           attention $A\left(t,c\right)$

\paragraph{Goal} For each tag, we want to identify the collection(s) that particularly prefer(s) the tag, if any. Then such a cloud is a friend (or the best friend if there is only one) for the tag. The simplest example: imagine that only one cloud pays attention to the tag in hand. We intend to express the meaning of the word "particularly" in this context by a statistical test.

Let's denote the rank of the $i$-th tag's attention value paid by $j$-the collection inside the collection, or, in our notation, rank of $A_{ij}$ in $A_{*j}$ column, as $r(t_i,c_j)$. 

The main idea of the test is that if a tag $t_i$ is now preferred by any collection, the distribution of the ranks of the tag in all the collections $r(t_i,c_j)$ behaves like $j$  i.i.d integers that are uniformely distributed in $1..n$

Let's illustrate the method with something supersimple.

```{r}
regulation<-matrix(ncol = 3,nrow=7)
rownames(regulation)<-c("Gene1","Gene2","Gene3","Gene4","Gene5","Gene6","Gene7")
colnames(regulation)<-c("TF1","TF2","TF3")
regulation[1,]<-c(0.2,0.1,0.3)
regulation[2,]<-c(2,3,1)
regulation[3,]<-c(0.1, 6 ,0.05 )
regulation[4,]<-c(0.4, 1 ,3 )
regulation[5,]<-c(0.25,0.15 ,0.3 )
regulation[6,]<-c(2,0.9 ,0.4 )
regulation[7,]<-c(.7,0.1 ,11 )
noquote(relation)
```

First, let's apply the Bayesian version of the method, `best.friends.bic`.

```{r}
best.friends.bic(regulation,prior.to.have.friends = .5)
```

The lower is the prior to have friends for a tag (it is an obligatory parameter for `best.friends.bic`), the less marker-friend pairs we get.

```{r}
best.friends.bic(regulation,prior.to.have.friends = .25)
```

```{r}
best.friends.bic(regulation,prior.to.have.friends = .5, best.no = "all")
```
