Description: We have tags (rows) and collections (columns) and each tag-collection pair is described by the the value of the attention (real) the collection pays to the tag. Given the attention matrix, we want to identify whether a tag seperates all the collections by the relevance of the tag for the collections. The collection, for which the tag is relevant, is the tag's friend.
