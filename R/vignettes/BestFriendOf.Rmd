Both questions and much more questions of this kind (which gene behaves the most specifically like a selected one, etc..) based on the following consideration. Suppose we have any two sets, $A$ and $B$, and we have a pairwise relation measure $\left<a,b\right>$ for each of element $(a,b)$ of their Cartesian product $A x B$. Let's say the relation is similarity rather than distance, the higher it is, the more the elements in the pair are related. $A$ and $B$ could be the same. If a pair $(a,b)$ does not make a sense for the relation we describe, we can say that the measure is $\left<a,b\right>=0$. Now, for each selected $a \in A$ we can make a ranking of all the $b \in B$ elements based on the relation $\left<a,b\right>$. But, actually, the top of the ranking can be filles with $b$'s that do not specifically relate to the selected $a$, they just strongly interact with all or almost all the $a$'s. Sometimes, it makes sense (if we wnat to know what are strongest regulators for gene G?), but sometimes, we want to answer other question: what is the strongest specific regulator for gene G (let's call it the best friend of G). In our notation, $A$ is the set of genes, and $B$ is the set of regulators, and $ \left<a,b\right> $ is some regulatory strenght.

Let's think about ranks. Suppose we ranked all the $b$'s by $\left<a,b\right>$ for a selected $a$. The result is $Rank_a(b)= \# \left\{ \beta \in B : \left< a, \beta \right> \leqslant \left< a, b \right> \right\}$. To answer the 'best-friend' question, we are to calculate more complicated value. We want to raise up those $b$'s that are specifically similar to our $a$, so we first rank all $a$'s for all $b$'s by the $\left<a,b\right>$  values and then rank the ranks our selected $a$ get in the rankings for different $b$'s. The best rank $b$'s now are those that provide unusially high rank for our selcted $a$ in their ranking.

$$BFRank_a(b)=Rank_a(Rank_b(a))$$

Please note, the $\left<a,b\right>$ measure is not to be symmetric, the backwards value $\left<b,a\right>$ is never used and thus even not required to be defined.

### Code and examples in R

#### Best Friends ranking

And now, let's prepare a simple example. We have five genes (A,B,C,D,E) and three TFs (TF1,TF2,TF3). The strength of the regulation is shown by the matrix. 

```{r}
genes<-10
gene.names<-LETTERS[seq( from = 1, to = genes )]
regulation=matrix(
	c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.25, rep(0.2,genes-5),
	  rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes)
    ),
	ncol=10,byrow=FALSE
)
TF.names<-c('TF1','TF2','TF3','TF4','TF5','TF6','TF7','TF8','TF9','TF10')
rownames(regulation)<-gene.names
colnames(regulation)<-TF.names
```
So, we have the exmple relation matrix:
```{r}
noquote(format(regulation,digits = data.digits))
```

Applying the function to our example.

```{r}
friends<-best.friends.of.features(regulation)
noquote(format(friends,digits = p.val.digits))
```

Add some randomness:
```{r}
regulation[,2:ncol(regulation)]<-rep(runif(nrow(regulation)*(ncol(regulation)-1),0.5,1.5))
noquote(format(regulation,digits = data.digits))
```

```{r}
friends<-best.friends.of.features(regulation)
noquote(format(friends,digits = p.val.digits))

```

![Toy network example](green-6.png)

```{r}
connections<-matrix(nrow = 10,ncol=10,0)
names<-c('red','purple','blue','orange','green.1','green.2','green.3','green.4','green.5','green.6')
rownames(connections)<-names
colnames(connections)<-names
connections[,'red']<-5
connections['red',]<-5
connections['blue','orange']<-3
connections['orange','blue']<-3
connections['purple','blue']<-1
connections['blue','purple']<-1
diag(connections)=NA
```
