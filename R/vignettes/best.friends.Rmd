There is a simple intuition of what does it mean to be a friend. A friend of Augustus cares about Augustus more than about other persons. And, if one sees Augustus, it makes sense to infer to see friends(s) of Augustus also. Lets's try to translate it to staistical inferences.

Suppose we have set of elements $E$ and a set of communities $C$ of this elements with some fuzzy membership, e.g. there is a numeric measure of how an element is represented in a community $A\left(e_i,c_j\right)$ for each pair $(e_i,c_j) : e_i \in E\ ;\ c_j \in C$. The higher is $A\left(e_i,c_j\right)$ value is, the more $e_i$ is involved $c_j$. The absence of the element in the community is shown by the value that is minimal for the commumity. 

A good [example](#toyTF) that is easy to think about is: genes are elements and their regulation by transcription factors (TF's) form communities, and $A$ shows the strength of the regulation. We look at a gene and we want to know whether a TF is its friend, i.e. whether the TF specifically regulates the gene. The na&iuml;ve idea is to look for a TF that the gene is the most sensitive for. Still, it's possible that this TF is the strongest for the most of the genes. Sometimes, it is what we want to find, but now we want to answer other questions, namely, what TF is the most specific factor for the gene and is the specificity enough to say that is does not look like a random outcome?

Sometimes, the communities are in in one-to-one relation with the elements, e.g. [each $c_i$ is a set of neighbours of $e_i$ in some graph](#toynet). For this example, $A$ is a weighted adjacency matrix of this graph. The friendship terminology emerges naturally from this case. The friendship relation itself is asymmetric: a friend cares about Augustus, while Augustus does not.

## Best friends

For every entity $\epsilon$ let's rank all the features $f$ by the $A\left( f,\epsilon \right)$ value. The ranking is acsending, so rank 1 is for the maximal value. Let's normalise the ranks by dividing by $\left|F\right|$, and let's denote the resulting value as $r\left(f,\epsilon \right)$. All the values (let's refer to them as ranks) are in $\left[0,1\right]$. Let's look at the ranks of one selected feature $\varphi$ in different entities, $r\left( \varphi, e_j \right), e_j \in E$. If all the relations are at random (null hypothesis), the values $r\left( \varphi, e_j \right)$ are independently and uniformly distributed in  $\left[0,1\right]$. If an entity $e_j$ is friendly for the feature $\varphi$, the corresponding $r\left( \varphi, e_j  \right)$ is to be larger than the values for all other entitites $r\left( \varphi, e_m  \right), m \ne j$, and the difference is to be unexpectedly large for the null hypothesis. A friend of Augustus cares about Augustus more than about other persons. Let's take the difference between the mininal and the minimal of the remainder ranks (the best-after-the best) as the observation for feature $\varphi$. It characterise the differnce between the best (minimal) rank and all the others. U-statistics allows us to estimate the p-value for the observation, if it is low, to conclude that the entity $e_j$ is the best friend of the feature $\varphi$. In this case, $\varphi$ is a marker for $e_j$. For each feature, the `best.friends.of.features`, returns the possible best friend, and the p-value for the observation provided the null model. 

## Friends

The `best.friends.of.features` works great if the feature  $\varphi$ has only one best friend. What happens if there are more than one and they almost equally freindly to  $\varphi$. The difference between the best and the best-after-the-best is very small, and if fits the null hypothesis really well. But, if we go on looking at sequential differences in the ordering of ranks $r\left( \varphi, e_j  \right), e_j \in E$, we can find an unexpectegly high difference on one of the steps. Lets's denote the increasingly ordered  $r\left( \varphi, e_j  \right)$ as  $\left< \varphi, e_{j_i}  \right>$. 

Sometimes, the best friend differs only a bit from the next.

## Code and examples in R

```{r source, echo=FALSE}
if (!suppressWarnings(require('best.friends')))
{
	if (!suppressWarnings(require('devtools')))
	{
		source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
		biocLite("devtools")
		library("devtools")
	}
	install_github('favorov/gene-friends/pkg/R')
	library(best.friends)
}
data.digits=2
p.val.digits=4
```

### <a name="toyTF"></a> Toy example 1

And now, let's prepare a simple example. We have ten TFs (TF1, TF2, ..) and ten genes (A,B,...) The strength of the regulation is shown by the matrix. 

```{r}
genes<-10
gene.names<-LETTERS[seq( from = 1, to = genes )]
regulation=matrix(
	c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.25, rep(0.2,genes-5),
	  rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes),
		rep(1, genes)
    ),
	ncol=10,byrow=FALSE
)
TF.names<-c('TF1','TF2','TF3','TF4','TF5','TF6','TF7','TF8','TF9','TF10')
rownames(regulation)<-gene.names
colnames(regulation)<-TF.names
```
So, we have the exmple relation matrix:
```{r}
noquote(format(regulation,digits = data.digits))
```

Searching for the best friends for each feature:

```{r}
friends<-best.friends.test(regulation)
noquote(format(friends,digits = p.val.digits))
```

Searching for the all possible friend function to our example.
```{r}
all.friends<-friends.test(regulation)
noquote(all.friends)
```


Add some randomness:
```{r}
regulation[,2:ncol(regulation)]<-rep(runif(nrow(regulation)*(ncol(regulation)-1),0.5,1.5))
noquote(format(regulation,digits = data.digits))
```

```{r}
friends<-best.friends.test(regulation)
noquote(format(friends,digits = p.val.digits))

```

### Toy example 2

```{r}
mmm<-matrix(ncol = 3,nrow=7)
rownames(mmm)<-c("Feature1","Feature2","Feature3","Feature4","Feature5","Feature6","Feature7")
colnames(mmm)<-c("Entity1","Entity2","Entity3")
mmm[1,]<-c(0.2,0.1,0.3)
mmm[2,]<-c(2,3,1)
mmm[3,]<-c(0.1, 6 ,0.05 )
mmm[4,]<-c(0.4, 1 ,3 )
mmm[5,]<-c(0.25,0.15 ,0.3 )
mmm[6,]<-c(2,0.9 ,0.4 )
mmm[7,]<-c(.7,0.1 ,11 )
```
